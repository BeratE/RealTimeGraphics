# The C Real Time Graphics Library

A learning project for the sole purpose of learning the basics
of computer graphics and bare bones C Programming.
I like the challenge.

The Project contains:
* A Software Rendering Engine
* A minimal linear algebra library

The build system is CMake.
Unit testing is done by the CTest and Minutest Framework.
Display of rendered texture and input handling is done with SDL2.
